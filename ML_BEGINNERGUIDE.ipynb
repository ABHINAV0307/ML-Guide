During our learning/training process, this is commonly referred to as model. But technically the model is the result of the process."

If the dataset is labeled, like in our example, the prices of the house are given and we are trying to predict the price for new house, it is a supervised learning. If the dataset is not labeled and we are deriving some relationships in our dataset, this is unsupervised learning. An example is a dataset of customer purchases and we would like to do customer segmentation based on purchased products.\n",
